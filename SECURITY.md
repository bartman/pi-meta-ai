# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Handling secrets

- Never commit API keys (`LLM|...`), `.env`, or `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`
- Use `pi` `/login` flow which stores keys in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (chmod 600) or env vars
- `/meta status` masks keys as `LLM|...abcd` — safe to share screenshots
- If you accidentally commit a key, rotate immediately at https://dev.meta.ai → API keys

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Do NOT open a public issue for sensitive security reports
- Email maintainers via GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/seemethere/pi-meta-ai/security/advisories/new
- Or open an issue marked as security concern with no secret details

We aim to respond within 5 business days.
